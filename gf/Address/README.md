Some postprocessing (HTML->TXT) was applied to the original list
using `filter.sh`. The output of `filter.sh` can be converted into
GF using `make_street.py`.

This grammar demonstrates a simple language with a reasonably large
vocabulary (~1500 terminals).

TODO
----

  * switch off numbers that are greater than 999
  * refactor the grammar so that other towns (with their streets) can be easily plugged in
