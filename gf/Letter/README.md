Letter
======

*Letter* describes the 32 Estonian letters

    a b c d e f g h i j
    k l m n o p q r s š
    z ž t u v w õ ä ö ü
    x y

and their spelling alphabet. Ideally, one should be able to reference a letter
by its name (`bee`) as well as by its code word (e.g. `berta`), the latter
being more reliable but harder to learn. (Not sure if this is doable.)

Some variants were taken from:
