Addresses in Estonian towns
===========================

Introduction
------------

This is a simple grammar for addresses in Estonian towns, e.g.

  - Keskuse 18
  - Estonia puiestee
  - Kanuti aed

currently covering all Tallinn's street names (~1500) and
Tartu street names (~470), and
allowing them to be combined with numbers between 1 and 1000.
Also, some other place names (e.g. names of parks) are included.

The grammar is simple in the sense that it does not do any geocoding.
